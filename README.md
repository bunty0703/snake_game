***Snake Game in Python with Tkinter***

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Tkinter library for the GUI. The game features a snake that grows longer as it eats food, with the player controlling the snake's direction using arrow keys. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the game window.

**Features**

Responsive Controls: Use arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
Dynamic Gameplay: Randomized placement of food for varied gameplay experience.
Score Tracking: Keep track of your score as you eat food.
Game Over Detection: Detect collision with the snake's body or game window boundaries to end the game.
